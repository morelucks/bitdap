;; summary: Bitdap Pass – tiered membership NFT collection on Stacks.
;; description: >
;;   Bitdap Pass is a non-fungible token (NFT) collection that represents
;;   access passes to the Bitdap ecosystem. Each pass belongs to a tier
;;   (Basic, Pro, or VIP), which can be used by off-chain services or
;;   other contracts to gate features and experiences.
;;
;;   Milestone 1 – Concept & Rules:
;;   - Collection name: Bitdap Pass
;;   - Tiers: Basic, Pro, VIP
;;   - 1 owner per token-id, non-fractional NFTs
;;   - Future milestones will define minting, transfer logic, and metadata
;;     for each tier.

;; traits
;; - To be defined in later milestones (e.g., SIP-009 NFT trait implementation).
